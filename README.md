### In Canvas, answer the following questions:

- Which resource did you choose to use?
I used the SqlBolt resource and it had a lot of practice on it. There were also solutions so i wouldnt just be stuck there for long. 

- What are three things you learned during this lab?
during this lab i feel like i learned more on selecting queries with conditions. More practice means I will understand it better.
